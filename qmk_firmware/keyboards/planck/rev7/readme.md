# Planck

A compact 40% (12x4) ortholinear keyboard kit designed by OLKB and sold by Drop. A complete hardware rework of the rev6 Planck PCB, with support for up to 8 rotary encoders. [More info on qmk.fm](http://qmk.fm/planck/)

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Jack Humbert](https://github.com/jackhumbert)
* Hardware Supported: Planck PCB rev7
* Hardware Availability: [Drop](https://drop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard?mode=guest_open)

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make planck/rev7:default

## Encoders

Encoders much have matching pulse & detent resolutions (e.g. 24/24) for the scanning to work properly. Multiple encoders can be used at the same time, and are zero-indexed (compared to being one-indexed on the PCB's silkscreen) in the `encoder_update_user(index, clockwise)` function:

```
,-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   0  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   4  |
|------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------|
|   1  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   5  |
|------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------|
|   2  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   6  |
|------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------|
|   3  |      |      |      |      |             |      |      |      |      |   7  |
`-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
```

If an encoder has a switch built-in, it's connected to the key at that location. On the default keymap, each encoder will play its own rising/falling tone sequence when rotated, and will reset the pitch after one second of inactivity.
